If you don\u0026rsquo;t specify either interval_s or interval_ms in seconds or milliseconds, respectively, then the by default events are cached for 10 seconds before being forwarded to the backend.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t use histogram-type aggregations in your backend, you can disable it for some performance gains.\n[[pipeline.my_pipeline.steps]] type = \u0026quot;Buffer\u0026quot; interval_s = 30 enable_histograms = false  As a general rule, backends don\u0026rsquo;t handle errors in the upstream. If the upstream cannot accept a request for whatever reason, the events InGRAINd couldn\u0026rsquo;t deliver are not cached, they are simply dropped.\nConsole The Console backend is the simplest way to send events to another program. It will print JSON-formatted events, one event per line, on the standard output. You can enable it like this:\n[pipeline.console.config] backend = \u0026quot;Console\u0026quot;  It is great for interactive debugging purposes, or combining it with other tools as part of a log collector pipeline.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no other configuration the Console backend receives, so if you want to process the events, you will need to redirect the InGRAINd output to your preferred destination.\nNote that the Console backend is separate from the logging facilities, which happen on the standard error pipe, and use a completely different infrastrucure.\nS3 The S3 backend will place JSON-formatted data dumps in an S3 bucket. To configure the AWS connection, you can use environment variables or credentials files as described in the Rusoto documentation To specify which bucket to use, set the AWS_S3_BUCKET environment variable.\nThe files will have a name like hostname_123456789123456789.json, where the long number is the UNIX nanosecond-precise timestamp.\nStatsD+ The StatsD+ backend will forward events from InGRAINd to compatible StatsD servers, such as Grafana, Graphite, or even DataDog. If the backend supports tags for events, they are also forwarded.\nYou can add a StatsD+ backend like so, with tagged events disabled:\n[pipeline.statsd.config] backend = \u0026quot;StatsD\u0026quot; use_tags = false  Configuration of the upstream server is done is done through 2 environment variables:\n STATSD_HOST: the hostname or IP address of the StatsD server STATSD_PORT: the port number of the StatsD server  Both of the variables above need to be set in order for the backend to start.\nHTTP The HTTP server works similarly to the S3 backend, except it can forward your events to any HTTP server using a POST request.\nFor instance, a realistic HTTP backend could look like so:\n[pipeline.http.config] backend = \u0026quot;http\u0026quot; uri = \u0026quot;http://example.redsift.com/insert\u0026quot; encoding = \u0026quot;json\u0026quot; [pipeline.http.config.headers] authorization = \u0026quot;Basic realm token\u0026quot; \u0026quot;custom-header\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;some value\u0026quot;  To use authenticated endpoints, you can specify extra headers to be sent in the [pipeline.http.config.headers] map, however, these need to be stored in the config file in unencrypted form.\nIn addition, the HTTP endpoint can encode its payload as Cap\u0026rsquo;n Proto in addition to JSON. The schema for the current version can be found in the repository .\nUsing Cap\u0026rsquo;n Proto lets you shave off significant amount of time when receiving and parsing InGRAINd events, at the cost of additional complexity.\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/configuration/containers/','title':"Containers",'content':"Containers Monitoring containerised workloads is usually not an easy thing to do.

Run bindgen for all structs, the names of which start with _data_ (e.g. _data_tcp_connect).  bpf_helpers.h is in the include directory, so bindgen can be run freely on all .h files under bpf/. This is quirky, but works.\nThe produced BPF bytecode ELF packages are embedded in the final binary using include_bytes! statements. The produced bindings are embedded using include! statements.\nRuntime Grains are self-contained monitors and reporters. Each grain can gather their own type of statistics about a particular aspect of the system\u0026rsquo;s operation. Grains need to manage any BPF modules they might be using. Every grain is coupled with a dedicated cloud-based analytics backend.\nBPF probes are using the kernel\u0026rsquo;s eBPF virtual machine to execute a safe bytecode directly in kernel-space. These modules can only interact with the outside world using well-defined interfaces, and cannot execute arbitrary system calls.\nThe BPF modules will send data to userland using perf_event ring-buffers. These ring-buffers are fixed size buffers with a size multiples of the platform native VMM page size (4k on x86/x64).\nImportant to note 2 things:\n The license of BPF modules needs to be GPL is we want to extract data from the kernel into userland through the perf_event interface. If the module\u0026rsquo;s version does not match the running kernel\u0026rsquo;s version number, the kernel will refuse to load the module. The workaround here is using 0xFFFFFFFE in the binary to stay compatible with gobpf. This version will be replaced runtime by redbpf.  After the BPF probes are parsed from the ELF files, the following syscalls are made, in order:\n bpf_create_map: All global data is stored in maps. These structures are allocated during parsing. bpf_prog_load: Load a program into the BPF VM, and initialise it bpf_attach_kprobe: Attach BPF probes to a syscall. Entry probes and return probes are possible, they will be called when entering or exiting a syscall, respectively. bpf_update_elem: the perf_event ringbuffers are initialised. This includes allocating a perf_reader object, which are used for userspace consumption of the bpf_perf_event_output calls in the probes.  Perf Events Ingraind uses the perf_event_open (2) interface to communicate with the kernel\u0026rsquo;s BPF VM.\nThe BPF modules will access the perf_event ring buffers through a BPF_MAP structure of type BPF_MAP_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY. The maps contain an fd that is keyed by the CPU id. Technically, multiple strategies are allowed for keying this map, but the most popular looks like setting up a separate ring buffer for every online single CPU.\nEvents are consumed using an epoll_wait loop, and read until exhaustion. The benefit of a single epoll_wait loop is that all the complex logic behind initialisation of different grains ultimately ends up allowing notifications through a single fd, including all network, and even perf_event buffers.\nELF parsing A thing to note here before I get into this, is how state is managed in the BPF VM. There\u0026rsquo;s no global state allowed, so anything that needs to be persisted between calls into the probe needs to go through BPF_MAP_.* structures through VM opcodes (#define'd as function calls, eg. update, delete, etc.).\nA corollary to this is that global state used in the C source code is stored in the ELF binary in named PROGBITS sections , then loaded and initialised to be BPF_MAPs by the loader as data. We load this into memory, treating it as configuration, then instruct the kernel to set up global state storage to get an fd in return. This fd can also be used to send data back and forth between kernel- and userspace in certain cases.\nIt gets interesting when these are referenced in code (functions). The compiler generates a REL section that links to the symbol table, and has an info field that is a link to the amended section of code. The offset field specifies the offset in bytes from the start of the section that needs to be modified. A relocation, strictly in the BPF context, is a rewrite instruction for a specific instruction, in a specific section, referencing a specific symbol.\nBecause data access is always through VM opcodes, the instruction at the offset location is\u0026hellip; something. We don\u0026rsquo;t actually care. Relocations tell us to\u0026hellip; do something with it.\nWe need to rewrite the instruction\u0026rsquo;s source register (src_reg) with BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_FD, and the immediate constant parameter (imm) with the fd of the map that\u0026rsquo;s referenced by the symbol.\nSo to recap, this is the workflow to deal with loading ELF files:\n Load the strings table Load the symbol table Parse all the sections Create BPF_MAPs from the maps/ sections to acquire fds Go through all code sections, and apply relocations such that:  Resolve all REL symbols into fds (through the symbol table and back again). Rewrite the instruction at specified offset    "});index.add({'id':11,'href':'/docs/devel/performance/','title':"Performance",'content':"Performance The following measurements were done on an 8-core Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz, Arch Linux, and ingraind @ 43281a7 .\nThe following command will produce the raw output:\ncargo build --release \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ sudo AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=x \\ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=x \\ AWS_BUCKET=x \\ AWS_INTERVAL=30 \\ DNS_IF=wlp61s0 \\ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/ingraind \u0026amp; sleep 5 \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (top -b -d 2 |grep ingraind) \u0026gt;top_log \u0026amp; \\ iperf3 -t 10 -b 10M -c localhost \u0026gt; iperf_log \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sleep 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; iperf3 -t 10 -b 100M -c localhost \u0026gt;\u0026gt;iperf_log \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sleep 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; iperf3 -t 10 -b 1000M -c localhost \u0026gt;\u0026gt;iperf_log \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sleep 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; iperf3 -t 10 -b 10000M -c localhost \u0026gt;\u0026gt;iperf_log \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pkill top \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; @ pkill ingraind  Looking through the logs, we can see that CPU use follows bandwidth:\n   Bandwidth CPU %     10M 1%   100M 4%   1000M 32%   10000M 98%     This is test only measures the TCPv4 throughput of the one process, but gives a good idea about scaling.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/docs/devel/profiling/','title':"Profiling",'content':"Profiling During development The recommended way to profile ingraind binaries is using perf.
